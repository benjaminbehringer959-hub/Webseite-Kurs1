    <h1>Welcome to the Mind for Media course</h1>
    <div class="rich-text">
    <p>Nice to have you here. If you opened this course, it is probably not because something is &quot;wrong&quot; with you. It is because you noticed that your day sometimes feels louder than it should. Maybe it is hard to stay with your studying. Maybe your head feels full even when you have enough time. Or maybe you simply felt that your phone takes up more space than you want to give it. Whatever brought you here: you do not have to explain it, and you do not have to justify it.</p>
<p>Mind for Media is not a classic digital detox. This course does not want to forbid anything or force you into anything. It is not about becoming more disciplined, tougher, or &quot;better.&quot; It is about something else. It is about understanding how your daily life, your learning, and your phone interact. It is about getting a sense of focus, calm, and clarity again in a way that fits you.</p>
<p>Many people know these moments: you sit down, want to start, and almost automatically reach for your phone. You are studying, but your head feels tired before you are really in it. Or you notice in the evening that the day is gone without being able to say what filled it. These are not personal weaknesses. They are understandable reactions in an environment that constantly asks for attention. This is exactly where this course begins.</p>
<p>Over the next 20 days, it is not about &quot;pushing through.&quot; You will observe, try things, and understand, step by step. Each day is intentionally manageable so it fits into your life, even in stressful phases. Change does not come from pressure here, but from clarity. Not from bans, but from better decisions in the right moment. And not all at once, but quietly - and noticeably.</p>
<p>You can move through this course at your own pace. There is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; Everything you notice is valuable - including doubts, resistance, or days when nothing seems to change. When you look back after these 20 days, it should not feel like you bent yourself into shape. It should feel like you gained more overview, more calm, and more freedom to choose.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking this time. For you, your mind, and your everyday life.</p>
